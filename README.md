# IGA-SoftAppliance

This is a software appliance that can run an Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) platform. This can be used for small deployments in a production environment (under 250 identities) or used as an isolated development/lab environment.

This project includes a soft appliance based on a LAMP stack, using CentOS 7. The soft appliance is distributed as an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image. This will contain everything needed to build out a development/learning environment, including the open source OrangeHRM application to serve as the authoritative source of truth for identities. If using in a production environment some additional configurations will be required based on the business needs and existing infrastructure.

This software appliance DOES NOT contain any IGA software pre-installed. The soft appliance is designed to run IGA platforms such as SailPoint IIQ, RSA IGL, One Identity: Identity Manager, or Core Security- Access, Provisioning, & Identity Suite; as examples. The previously mentioned examples do require licensing, please reach out to those vendors if needed. You can also use free and/or open source platforms such as OpenIAM (__www.openiam.com__) or Soffid (__www.soffid.com/__).

## Deployment

#### _Enterprise_
Within an enterprise environment, using bare metal, it is recommended to use ESXi/vSphere, Xen, or Proxmox. If Hyper-V is preferred, then you will need to leverage a 3rd tool to convert the OVA to a VHD format. Using Hyper-V is not recommended or supported at the moment. You can also also leverage the AWS CLI to deploy the OVA to an EC2 instance. Navigate here for guidance: __https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vm-import/__

#### _Lab Environment_
If used as an isolated learning/lab environment VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player should be used. VirtualBox is preferred and recommended.

#### _Default Usernames/Passwords_
All default usernames and passwords are included within the Description of the OVA image itself. It is also available in the _ReadMe.txt_ file on the desktop. All passwords should be changed immediately if this is being deployed within an enterprise. It is also recommended to changed default usernames/passwords even if only being used locally or within a lab environment.

#### _Default VM Configs_
The default settings for the soft appliance are as follows; change accordingly as needed
- vCPU: 2
- RAM: 4GB
- Storage: 50GB (Dynamically Allocated)
- NIC: Bridged Adapter
- Shared Clipboard: Bidirectional
